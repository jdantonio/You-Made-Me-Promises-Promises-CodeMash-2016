# You Made Me Promises Promises

This repo contains the slide deck from my [presentation](http://www.codemash.org/session/you-made-me-promises-promises/) at CodeMash 2016.

# Abstract

> Promises are the go-to concurrency tool in JavaScript, but what about other languages? It turns out that promises are pretty much everywhere. Clojure, Scala, Haskell, and Java have them. Elixir and C# have task constructs that are very similar. Even Ruby has them: Microsoft’s Azure SDK makes heavy use of promises from the concurrent-ruby gem. In this talk we’ll take an in-depth look at this simple yet versatile tool. We’ll talk about why they are so popular, how to use them well, and when promises may not be the best choice. Along the way we’ll compare promise code in several languages.
